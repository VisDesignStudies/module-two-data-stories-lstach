The web page for this assignment can be viewed live [here](https://assignment-2-lstach.tiiny.site/)!

Please note that, in order to allow D3 to access the 2 CSVs used for my D3 visualizations while hosting the html page, I had to make the GitHub repository public.  This allows it to access the raw data for the CSVs.  If you make this repository private, the HTML page should still work, but the D3 visualizations won't be able to load.

Also, to interact with the visualiations, click the images used in the page.  For the line chart, hover over the points along each line to see the exact data point.
